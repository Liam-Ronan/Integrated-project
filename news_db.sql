Despite obliterated terrain and internet wires, fire-blackened data centers, curfews, lack of light, and the danger of death from above, the fixers go out and turn the internet back on so Ukrainians can stay in touch with one another and get word out beyond borders, to illuminate for the world the darkness that’s descended on their nation.

On Tuesday, the country’s security services said a “hacker” had been arrested for providing “the occupiers with mobile communications in Ukraine.” The authorities announced on Telegram the hacker had facilitated up to 1,000 calls in one day, many from Russian leadership in Moscow. According to one telecoms company source, this latest case was a twist on what’s known as “refiling” fraud, where the hacker can provide calls into Ukraine and hide the originating number, charging a fee to the caller and bypassing any blocks or additional charges from the telecoms provider. This was a common fraudster technique adapted for wartime, the telecoms employee said.\r\n\r\nAnd while bombs are effective enough at wiping out connectivity, it’s clear Ukraine’s enemies have felt it necessary to employ hackers to try to knock citizens offline too. In recent days, Forbes has learned more about a sustained cyber operation targeting Ukraine’s telecoms providers. Last week, it emerged that systems at Triolan had been reset to factory settings as hackers hit for a second time, the first hit landing as Russia launched its assault on February 24. Both ended up causing outages, which persist through to today, though every day Triolan updates users on Telegram with its progress. On Tuesday, another 200 houses in Kyiv got their internet back, in Kharkiv 474. “Restoration work is being completed,” said a Triolan employee, who added “other providers also had problems, but we cannot assess the scale.”\r\n\r\nAnother small provider - Vinasterisk - had been targeted and suffered significant downtime earlier this month, according to NetBlocks, which has been tracking internet outages in Ukraine.

He certainly knew that he had transformed from a once raging comet into a massive but somehow irrelevant superstar. That was tough to live with. He was a good hearted, well meaning, thoughtful man and it hurt. What made it all the more difficult was that he actually liked being Elvis.

Yes many of the songs had been recorded before by relatively unknown black performers and, yes, Elvis got his moves from the likes of Wynonie Harris and Sonny Til – but even so.  And it’s complicated because Elvis was as much Bill Monroe and Dean Martin as he was Arthur Crudup. He was also an inspired original.

Perhaps their defining attribute was that they were free to use, indeed some still are, available for people to just walk in and play.\r\n\r\nIn Ireland, the earliest written record of a handball game is in the town statutes of Galway in 1527, which forbade the playing of ball games against the walls of the town. Architect Áine Ryan\'s research records how the earliest known handball alley constructed in Ireland dates from around the 1790s and was located at Carnew, Co. Wicklow.\r\n\r\nThe GAA wrote the first rules for the modern game of handball and it was included in the GAA Charter of 1884 as one of the sports to be promoted by the new Association. In 1924, Comhairle Liathróid Láimhe na hÉireann (the Irish Handball Council) was established to promote, develop and organise the sport. In the same year, the Irish Amateur Handball Association was founded. It held its inaugural meeting on 27 January 1924 in Croke Park.\r\n\r\nThe game involves players hitting a ball with a hand or fist against a wall to make a shot the opposition cannot return. Originally, an alley measuring 60 by 30 feet (18.3 by 9.1 m) was used with a 30-foot (9.1 m) front wall, against which the ball must be struck. A smaller alley was also introduced, measuring 40 by 20 feet (12.2 by 6.1 m) with a front wall 20 feet (6.1 m) high. The first of the latter size was built in Ireland in 1969. This size is now the standard in the international version of the game, but both alleys are still used in the Gaelic game, with two separate championships run by the GAA.\r\n\r\nThe Bawn Handball Club first met in an alley in Lisinisky, Bawn, County Monaghan in June 1931. To raise funds for the building of the alley, the Club held several dances. By August 1932, aided by many volunteers, the work of building the alley and stand was completed at a total cost of £198. The result, a functional structure with no additional decoration, became a gathering point for a dispersed rural community.\"\r\n', '2022-02-06', 7, 3),

Now, researchers have gotten up-close views of these syringes, technically known as contractile injection systems, from a type of cyanobacteria and a marine bacterium', 'Some bacteria carry tiny syringes filled with chemicals that may thin out competitors or incapacitate predators. Now, researchers have gotten up-close views of these syringes, technically known as contractile injection systems, from a type of cyanobacteria and a marine bacterium.\r\n\r\nFiguring out how key parts of the molecular syringes work may help scientists devise their own nanomachines. Artificial injection machines could direct antibiotics against troublesome bacteria while leaving friendly microbes untouched.\r\n\r\nGenes encoding pieces of the injection machinery are found in many bacterial species. But, “just by looking at the genes, it’s quite hard to predict how these contractile injection systems work,” says Gregor Weiss, a cellular structural biologist at ETH Zurich.\r\n\r\nSo Weiss and colleagues examined bacterial syringes using cryo-electron microscopy, in which cells are flash frozen to capture cellular structures as they typically look in nature (SN: 6/22/17).\r\n\r\nPreviously, researchers have found syringes anchored in some bacteria’s outer membranes, where the bacteria can shoot their payload into cells they bump into. Other species’ injectors squirt their contents into the environment.\r\n\r\nBut in a type of cyanobacteria called Anabaena, the syringes are in an unusual place, nestled in the membrane of the internal structure where the bacteria carry out photosynthesis, Weiss and colleagues report in the March Nature Microbiology. Buried inside the cells, “it’s hard to imagine how [the syringes] could get out and interact with the target organism,” Weiss says.\r\n\r\nAnabaena may use its syringes against itself to trigger programmed cell death when the cyanobacteria come under stress. In the team’s experiments, ultraviolet light or high salt levels in water triggered some syringes to dump their payload. That led to the death of some Anabaena cells in the long chains that the cyanobacteria grow in, forming hollow “ghost cells.”\r\n\r\nGhost cells shed their outer wall and membrane, exposing unfired syringes in the inner membrane to the outside. The ghosts may act like Trojan horses, delivering their deadly payload to predators or competitors, the team hypothesizes. The researchers haven’t yet found which organisms are the probable targets of Anabaena’s syringes.\r\n\r\nInside a type of marine bacteria called Algoriphagus machipongonensis, the story is a bit different. Here, the syringes have a different architecture and float unmoored within the bacterial cell, ETH Zurich’s Charles Ericson and colleagues report in the March Nature Microbiology. The injectors are also found in the liquid in which the bacteria are grown in the laboratory, but how they get out of the cell is a mystery. Perhaps they are released when the bacteria die or get eaten by a predator, Ericson says.\r\n\r\nThe team also found two proteins loaded inside the Algoriphagus’ syringes, but what those proteins do isn’t known.

That might seem like a lot but €1 billion is what we\'re paying Putin every day for the energy he provides us with,\"\" said Mr Borrell.\r\n\r\nLeading Ukrainian scientist Dr Svitlana Krakovska, who is a member of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), said the money being invested in fossil fuels is being used against Ukraine, and is enabling the war.\r\n\r\nWhile Putin\'s former chief economic adviser, Dr Andrei Illarionov told the BBC that a full embargo on Russian oil could stop Putin\'s war: \"\"It\'s one of the very effective instruments still in the possession of the Western countries.\"\"\r\n\r\nThe EU has responded to the Russian invasion with more speed and unity than has been seen in decades. Some member states are urging the bloc not to lose that momentum and instead use it to speed up investment in renewables.\r\n\r\nEU urged to end reliance on Russian coal, gas and oil\r\n\r\nEleven member states, led by Denmark, warn the world faces a new geopolitical reality and that decisive action needs to be taken in response to Russia\'s aggression.\r\n\r\nIn a statement, it said: \"\"We must maintain the same unity and determination in order to become independent of Russian fossil fuels as soon as possible through accelerating the green transition towards climate neutrality in the EU by 2050 at the latest.\"\"\r\n\r\nThe opportunity comes at a time when the latest report from the UN\'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change made clear that \"\"it\'s now or never\"\" to avoid climate catastrophe.\r\n\r\nUpon the IPCC report\'s release, EU climate policy chief Frans Timmermans urged European policymakers to redouble efforts to end reliance on Russian coal, gas and oil.\r\n\r\n\"\"The war in Ukraine has only increased our sense of urgency because now nobody can find an excuse, in my view, to not speed up the end of the overuse of fossil fuels,\"\" Timmermans told the European Parliament. \"\"We cannot continue to import massive amounts of fossil fuels.\"\"\r\n\r\nIn a fifth round of sanctions, the EU banned imports of Russian coal. This week, horrified by the devastation wreaked by Russian troops in Ukraine, EU foreign ministers launched discussions on a sixth round of sanctions, but a consensus is proving increasingly difficult.\r\n\r\nFollowing discussions Josep Borrell said: \"\"Nothing is off the table, including sanctions on oil and gas. But today, no decision was taken.\"\"\r\n\r\nThe response is different for different countries depending on access to energy alternatives, development plans for green transition, national policies, along with other factors. Some are further along the line to switch to clean energy than others.\r\n\r\nDr James Carton, Assistant Professor in Sustainable Energy in Dublin City University, believes what the crisis in Ukraine has done across the world, is finally \"\"put the nail in the coffin of coal\"\".\r\n\r\n\"\"I think even in Ireland here we have Money Point, and Kilroot in the north of Ireland, heavily reliant on coal and Russian coal at that. I think in the short term, they\'re looking at alternative sources of coal, but in the long term, they will be shut down within the next two to three years, one hopes. That will severely benefit our emissions,\"\" said Dr Carton.\r\n\r\nHe also said there is a lot of strategic things happening with this war in relation to power and energy.\r\n\r\n\"\"Ukraine actually interconnected with Europe for the first-time electricity wise. And Nord Stream two, which was a gas pipeline directly coming from Russia to Germany has been stopped, whether it\'s going to be brought back to life in a couple of years\' time, I\'m not sure. Ultimately, the minute Russian forces invaded Ukraine, the global future of energy changed irreversibly.\r\n\r\n\"\"We need to take the opportunity here to reduce emissions. We need to look at other things that are in fossil fuels and take these bad things that are happening across the world as messages to say we need to do something good here. And decarbonising our societies is a good thing for peace and security,\"\" said Dr Carton.\r\n\r\nSome of the difficulty on reaching fast consensus on more energy sanctions is down to some EU countries being less reliant on Russian energy imports than others and having better energy security.\r\n\r\nDr Carton said: \"\"I think the real question is what\'s going to happen in the next few months, or next year or two, on really important key countries such as Germany, what\'s going to happen with OPEC, and what are they going to do with oil over the next short term.\"\"\r\n\r\nGermany, Europe\'s largest economy which relies on Russian gas for much of its energy needs, warned that while it supported ending Russian energy imports as soon as possible it could not do it overnight.\r\n\r\nBefore Russia began its war in Ukraine, a third of Germany\'s oil imports, 45% of its coal purchases and 55% of gas imports came from Russia.\r\n\r\nThe country has set about weaning itself off Russia energy imports, accelerating investments in renewables and building liquefied natural gas (LNG) gas terminals to diversify its supplies.\r\n\r\nLate last year the Green Party was elected as part of a coalition government, promising a lot of ambitious targets when it came to the climate and efforts to turbo charge the energy transition.\r\n\r\nBut a vulnerability in Germany\'s \'Energiewende\' plans, or energy transition, has been exposed. Berlin\'s aim was to phase out coal and nuclear power by using Russian gas as a bridge fuel. This strategy is being challenged by sanctions related concerns.\r\n\r\nAccording to climate state secretary Patrick Graichen, \"\"the bridge has collapsed\"\" as a result of the war in Eastern Europe, which \"\"has broken the narrative of natural gas as a bridging technology\"\".\"\r\n\r\n', '2022-04-14', 5, 2),

We give just a few pointers.\r\n\r\nWhy, one wonders, should technical writing be so boring to read? The writers within the IT industry almost try to make a virtue of their ability to repel the readers.\r\n\r\nPart of the problem is that there is no best-practice to emulate. We have a lot to be ashamed of in the way we communicate. Another aspect of the problem is that a lot of writing is not even intended to convey meaning; instead, it is a technique for obfuscating technologies, in embellishing the importance of the writer, or in conveying the vague impression that a particular technology is splendid.\r\n'),

Political stories can be written in the inverted pyramid style. However, because political issues can usually be seen from a number of different viewpoints, political stories are often more complicated to write than a simple report of an event.
